# Learning Machine Learnings and Deep Learnings

## Journey Overview 
I'll be sharing everything I learn on my journey of learning machine learning and deep learning. From basics to advanced concepts, I'll cover essential tools and practical applications. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding, my posts will be a helpful resource, documenting the learning process with hands-on experiences in machine learning and deep learning.

**1.Day_1 of Learning:**
- **Data Inspecting**: Embarking on the journey of learning machine learning and deep learning, I initiated the process with an analysis of a dataset related to crabs. Key preprocessing steps included refining column names and mapping categorical values in the 'species' and 'sex' columns. The introduction of a new 'class' column by amalgamating values from 'species' and 'sex' was followed by presenting concise descriptive statistics and visualizations. This foundational analysis serves as a pivotal step in my pursuit of mastering machine learning and deep learning concepts.

**2.Day_2 of Learning:**
- **Principal Component Analysis:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space. It identifies orthogonal axes, called principal components, capturing the maximum variance in the data. PCA utilizes eigenvalues and eigenvectors to determine these components, resulting in uncorrelated variables.

On the second day of exploring machine learning and data analysis, i focused on implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction on a crab dataset. After standardizing numerical features and conducting PCA, the script presented key metrics like explained variance ratios and cumulative explained variance. Visualizations, including scree plots and heatmaps, offered insights into the dataset's structure. The transformed data was utilized to create 2D and 3D scatter plots, providing a visual representation of patterns. This day's work significantly contributed to understanding advanced techniques for data exploration and dimensionality reduction using PCA.
