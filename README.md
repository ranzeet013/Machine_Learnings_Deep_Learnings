# Learning Machine Learnings and Deep Learnings

## Journey Overview 
I'll be sharing everything I learn on my journey of learning machine learning and deep learning. From basics to advanced concepts, I'll cover essential tools and practical applications. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding, my posts will be a helpful resource, documenting the learning process with hands-on experiences in machine learning and deep learning.

- **Data Inspecting**: Embarking on the journey of learning machine learning and deep learning, I initiated the process with an analysis of a dataset related to crabs. Key preprocessing steps included refining column names and mapping categorical values in the 'species' and 'sex' columns. The introduction of a new 'class' column by amalgamating values from 'species' and 'sex' was followed by presenting concise descriptive statistics and visualizations. This foundational analysis serves as a pivotal step in my pursuit of mastering machine learning and deep learning concepts.
