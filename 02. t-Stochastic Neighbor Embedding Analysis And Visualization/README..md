### 01. t-SNE Analysis And Visualization on Raw Data :

I applied t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to a cleaned crab dataset for efficient dimensionality reduction and visualization. Using key columns such as 'frontal_lobe,' 'rear_width,' and others, I generated both 2D and 3D scatter plots, revealing intricate patterns and clusters within the high-dimensional data. The color-coded 2D plot highlighted distinct crab classes, while the 3D visualization added depth and complexity to the exploration. These t-SNE visualizations serve as insightful tools for quickly interpreting the dataset's inherent structures and relationships.

### 02. t-SNE Analysis And Visualization on Scaled Data :

I first applied Min-Max Scaling to a cleaned crab dataset, ensuring standardized numerical values for specific features. Subsequently, I employed t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to visualize the scaled data in both 2D and 3D formats. The resulting scatter plots reveal intricate structures and clusters within the dataset, with color-coded distinctions highlighting different crab classes. This combined approach of scaling and t-SNE visualization enhances the interpretability of the dataset, providing valuable insights into its underlying patterns and relationships.

### 03. t-SNE Analysis And Visualize on Standard Data :

I first standardized a cleaned crab dataset using Z-score normalization (Standard Scaling). The selected features, including 'frontal_lobe,' 'rear_width,' and others, were transformed to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Subsequently, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) was applied to generate 2D and 3D visualizations. The resulting scatter plots effectively showcase intricate structures and clusters within the standardized data, with color-coded distinctions for different crab classes. This combined approach of standardization and t-SNE visualization enhances the interpretability of the dataset, offering valuable insights into its inherent patterns and relationships.
